<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160We appreciate your interest in our insurance services and company. We primarily offer our insurance policies directly to residents of the United States; however, since you have purchased an insurance policy through {{$parent.data.message.closing.name}} and your payment has been approved, we will honor the policy you purchased even if you reside outside of the US.</p>

<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Please be advised that the difference in location or distance might increase the timeframes we usually take for the procedures to be completed, but in no way will affect the coverage offered.</p>
