<p>The insurance agreement that you purchased does not cover any pre-existing medical conditions, so unfortunately if you purchase our insurance while being aware of the condition which might prevent you from traveling, our policy unfortunately may not be able to cover that situation. As stated on your Policy our company defines a pre-existing condition as:</p>

<p>Any injury occurring prior to and including the effective date of insurance; or, any illness occurring 120 days prior to the purchase of the contract including the effective date of insurance for which treatment by a licensed physician has been sought or advised, or for which symptoms exist which would cause a prudent person to seek diagnosis, care or treatment.<p>
