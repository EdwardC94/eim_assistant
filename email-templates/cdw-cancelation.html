<br><p>Thank you for contacting Allianz Global Assistance regarding your Travel insurance.<span data-ng-hide="$parent.data.message.empathy_statement !== ''"> Iâ€™m sorry to hear you had to cancel your Rental Car Reservation and you need to cancel your insurance policy, but it will be my pleasure to assist you with this request.</span><span data-ng-show="$parent.data.message.empathy_statement !== ''"> {{$parent.data.message.empathy_statement}}</span></p> 

<p>Per your request I have cancelled your Car Rental Protection since you did not pick up the rental car/ had to purchase the rental company coverage.  You will also receive a separate email from us confirming the cancellation and advising you that the amount of ${{$parent.data.pol.payment.amount}} will be refunded back to the {{$parent.toTitleCase($parent.data.pol.payment.brand)}} credit card used for purchase <span data-ng-show="$parent.data.pol.payment.l4d !== ''">ending in {{$parent.data.pol.payment.l4d}} </span>, which should reflect within your next billing statement. Please be advised that you will no longer be able to file a claim with Allianz Global Assistance should anything happen to the rental car.</p>
