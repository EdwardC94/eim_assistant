<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160We appreciate your interest in our company; while processing your request on our system, it appears that the charge for the insurance was declined due to this particular product not being available in your state of residence.</p>

<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Due to this, the charge for the policy was never taken out from your account, I would advise to you to contact your ticket provider for other options to insure your investment and to confirm the validity of your ticket purchase with them.</p>

<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160If you are still interested in obtaining the coverage for your upcoming reservation, we encourage you to contact us at the telephone number provided below, and our Sales Associates will be happy to assist you with your purchase.  At the time of your call, please refer the Policy Number provided above to expedite the process.</p>
