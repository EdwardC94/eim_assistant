<p>We appreciate your interest in our insurance services and company. If you have not already done so, you can visit our websites at:</p>

<p>You will be able to view and compare our plans to determine which best fits your needs, as well as the terms and conditions that govern the policies. We also allow a timeframe depending on your state of residence to review your agreement, starting from the date of purchase, and if you do not feel satisfied with the benefits we will refund the insurance premium if you cancel your plan within the given timeframe and you haven’t started your trip or filed a claim.</p>

<p>Also, to see if we are able to provide you with a travel insurance policy at this time, I advise it may be more beneficial for you to call us at any time to the phone number listed below so that we may clarify the questions you have regarding our policy’s pricing and coverage.</p>
