<p>Unfortunately, we are not able to make any changes to the policy holder's name. If this is imperative for you to have your name listed as the primary insured, my advice would be to cancel this policy and then purchase a new one. In case you decide to purchase a new policy, it is important for you to know that the price may not be the same and there could be slight modifications on your coverage.</p>
