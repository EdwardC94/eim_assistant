<p>The Insurance Agreement protects the non-refundable and pre-paid expenses such as: airline tickets, hotel deposits or tour packages. It is very important for you to keep in mind that this policy works on a reimbursement basis, therefore, if you incur in any additional expenses you will need to cover them in advance and then seek for a reimbursement.</p>
<p>The Travel Protection provides coverage for the cancellation, interruption or even the modification of your trip due to unforeseen emergency situations, the policy is a named perils agreement, which means it covers only the specific situations, events and losses included in the contract, and only under the conditions described therein.</p> 
<p>The terms and conditions of our plans are available and can be viewed from our website, the airline’s or travel supplier’s website prior to purchase. The same terms and conditions are also emailed to you at the time of the purchase. We also allow a timeframe depending on your state of residence to review your agreement, starting from the date the contract was purchased, and if you do not feel satisfied with the benefits we will refund the insurance premium if you cancel your plan within the given timeframe and you haven’t started your trip or filed a claim.</p>
<p>I have sent you a copy of your Letter of Confirmation and the insurance policy via email to: {{$parent.data.pol.pH.email}}. Please allow 24 hours to receive it and make sure to verify within your spam folder as sometimes our emails can be filtered as such.</p>
