<br><p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Thank you for contacting Allianz Global Assistance.<span data-ng-hide="$parent.data.message.empathy_statement">&#160Although we are sorry to hear you had to modify your plans</span><span data-ng-show="$parent.data.message.empathy_statement">&#160{{$parent.data.message.empathy_statement}}</span>; it will be my pleasure to assist you today.</p> 

<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160We received your request to change your policy information but unfortunately I must advice you that we are unable to make any modifications to our policies once the original Departure Date has started. Since you first contacted us after {{$parent.data.pol.depD}}, we wonâ€™t be able to process your request.</p> 

<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160If you wish to modify and reuse your policy for a different trip, we must be able to verify that the original itinerary was cancelled and no claims were filed against it. You may send us your request using any of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fax : (804) 673-1598,</li> 
    <li>E-mail : salessupport@allianzassistance.com, or</li>
    <li>Conventional mail to : Allianz Global Assistance, Sales Support Department, P. O. Box 72031, Richmond, VA 23255.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Please send your written request along with any supporting documents, and mark your correspondence as: "Attention Sales Support," including your name and policy number. Please allow between 24 to 48 business hours from the reception of your information to get a response back from our special team.</p>
