<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160The Collision Damage Waiver protection provides primary coverage in case of a collision, loss or damage to your rental vehicle for ${{parent.data.pol.payment.amount}} USD per calendar day. The insurance protects against physical damage to the car that occurs while you are driving or while the vehicle is left unattended during the rental period.
