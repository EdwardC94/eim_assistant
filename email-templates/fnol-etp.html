<p>The Event Ticket Protector provides coverage for the cancellation to the attendance of your event due to an unforeseen emergency situation; the policy is a named perils agreement, which means it covers only the specific situations, events and losses included in the contract, and only under the conditions described therein.</p>

<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160You can file a claim on our website at www.eventticketprotection.com, under the option: “Claim Center” and then clicking on “File a Claim”. The system will require verification of your information first, so you can then complete an e-claim form and at the end of the process, you will be provided with a Claim Number. Also, you will be able to see the list of the documentation needed by the Claims Department to adjudicate your request. If you will be filing the claim due to a medical reason you will be required to supply a completed and signed Physician Statement form that you will be able to get over the website as well.  </p>
