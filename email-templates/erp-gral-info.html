<p>The Event Registration Protection provides coverage in case that you need to cancel the attendance to your event due to an unforeseen emergency situation. The policy is a named perils agreement, which means it covers only the specific situations, events and losses included in the contract, and only under the conditions described therein; also it is very important for you to keep in mind that this policy works on a reimbursement basis.</p>

<p>The terms and conditions of our plans are available and can be viewed from our website or the ticket supplier’s website prior to purchase. The same terms and conditions are also emailed to you at the time of the purchase. We also allow a timeframe depending on your state of residence to review your agreement, starting from the date the contract was purchased, and if you do not feel satisfied with the benefits we will refund the insurance premium if you cancel your plan within the given timeframe and you haven’t attended to the event or filed a claim.</p>

<p>I have sent you a copy of your confirmation letter and the insurance policy via email to: {{$parent.data.pol.pH.email}}. Please, allow 24 hours to receive it and also, be sure to also verify within your spam folder as sometimes our emails can be filtered as such.</p>
