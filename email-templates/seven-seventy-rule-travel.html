<p>We received your inquiry regarding cancelling your policy unfortunately we cannot cancel the policy at this point because it is past the 10 Day Satisfaction Guarantee period stated on the first page of your letter of confirmation.</p>

<p>If your trip was cancelled, you can still use your Travel insurance for 770 days after your purchase date of {{$parent.data.pol.doP}}. To qualify for future use, we must be able to verify that the original itinerary was cancelled and no claims were filed against it. When you reuse your policy, please send us your request in writing, including any supporting documentation for the cancellation.</p>
