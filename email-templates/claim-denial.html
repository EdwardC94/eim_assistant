<br><p>Thank you for contacting Allianz Global Assistance.<span data-ng-hide="$parent.data.message.empathy_statement">&#160We sincerely apologize that we were unable to meet your expectations. We try to satisfy all of our customers; however, we must abide by the insuring agreement’s terms and conditions that you agreed to upon purchase when we review claims.</span><span data-ng-show="$parent.data.message.empathy_statement">&#160{{$parent.data.message.empathy_statement}}</span></p> 

<p>The plan which you selected for your trip is a named perils agreement, which means it covers only the specific situations, events and losses included in the insuring agreement, and only under the conditions described therein. Not all plans are the same or contain the same benefits. For further consideration of travel insurance and choosing a plan more suited to your needs, please seek advice on the different types of policies available from a licensed insurance or travel agent.</p>

<p>We assure that the terms and conditions of our plans are available and can be viewed from the website of your airline or travel supplier prior to purchase. The same terms and conditions were also emailed to you at the time the insurance plan was purchased. We also allow a ten day period (starting from the date the contract was purchased) for you to review the terms and conditions, and we refund the insurance premium (if you cancel your plan within 10 days of purchase and you haven’t started your trip or filed a claim) if you are not satisfied with the terms and conditions of the insuring agreement.</p>

<p>In case that you would like to appeal the claim process you can send an email to claimappeals@allianzassistance.com.
 Please, feel free to add a copy of the documentation you sent in for the claim process along with your policy and claim number, full name, phone number, the best time for you to be contacted, any other additional documentation you may consider relevant for the case and a brief explanation stating why you are appealing the claim.</p>

<p>Please allow around 10 business days for our Claims Department to review the new documentation and to contact you with a response regarding the appeal.</p>
