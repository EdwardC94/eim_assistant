<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160Once your policy has been cancelled you will receive a refund of ${{$parent.data.pol.payment.amount}} back to the same card used for the purchase and should reflect within your next billing statement, as it might take your issuing bank a few extra days to process the refund.</p>
