<p>The Travel Protection provides coverage for cancellation or interruption of your trip due to an unforeseen emergency reason; either an emergency medical situation with yourself or a covered family member, or one of the specific emergency reasons for cancellation as outlined in the terms that govern the Policy.</p>
<p>Based on the information you have provided, it appears that your insurance may not be able to provide coverage. This is because it does not appear that your situation is included among those reasons that we outline in your insuring agreement.</p>

<p>I have sent you another copy of your Policy to the email address of {{$parent.data.pol.pH.email}}.</p>
