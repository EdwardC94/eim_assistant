<p>This insurance could provide you coverage for non-refundable and pre-paid expenses, airline tickets, hotel deposits or tour packages. It is very important for you to keep in mind that this Policy works on reimbursement basis, therefore, in case there is a penalty, you must pay it in advance and then seek reimbursement for it.</p>

<p>The Travel Protection provides coverage for cancellation or interruption of your trip due to an unforeseen emergency reason; either an emergency medical situation with yourself or a covered family member, or one of the specific emergency reasons for cancellation as outlined in the terms that govern the Policy.</p> 

<p>I have sent you a copy of your confirmation letter and the insurance Policy via email to: {{$parent.data[0].pol.pH.email}}. Please, allow 24 hours to receive it and also, be sure to also verify within your spam folder as sometimes our emails can be filtered as such.</p>
